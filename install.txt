You must first install a recent version of 
 - OCaml (at least 3.09.2), 
   see http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
 - the Menhir parser generator (at least 20080912),
   see http://cristal.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/
   (unless you got a version of the coccinelle source with
   the SmPL parser pre-generated)
 - Python and its development files (python-dev)
   (unless you run configure with the --without-python option)
 - pdftk and graphviz (with PDF support) if you want to use
   the -graphical_trace option   

Then simply type 
 ./configure
 make depend
 make
 make install
