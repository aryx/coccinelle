# this is a "hack" so that we do not have to pass --native to ocamldep
# and rebuild .depend when building the native version. Since we have
# .ml files without .mli files, building the .cmo *and .cmx file could
# cause the .cmi file to be build twice, which could cause trouble when
# the .cmi file is read by other compilation steps (especially when
# building in parallel).
